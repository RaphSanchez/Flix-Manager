<h2 class="mb-4 text-center">PREFACE</h2>
<p>
    Flix Manager was born in my journey to transition from a desktop applications 
    to a web applications developer and I sincerely hope it is of some
    use to other fellow developers that wish to make the same progression. What you
    will find in the application is a collection of data from multiple sources
    curated with a zero experience developer in mind to aid in his/her passage
    to a full stack .Net Blazor developer.

        Flix Manager is a free of charge progressive web application to manage
        a library of Movies that illustrates, from the ground up, all the major
        topics that any aspiring full stack .Net <a href="https://dotnet.microsoft.com/en-us/apps/aspnet/web-apps/blazor">
            Blazor
        </a> developer should be familiar with. It explains, provides data sources, and
        demonstrates the practical implementation of each subject.
    </p>
</div>
<p>
    I chose an application to manage a library of Movies because there are plenty
    of similar projects and data from <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/">
        Microsoft
    </a> (the creator of <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/csharp/tour-of-csharp/">
        CSharp)
    </a>, <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/">StackOverflow</a>, <a href="https://github.com/">
        GitHub
    </a>, and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/?reload=9">YouTube</a>. This makes it
    fairly trouble-free to research diverse approaches to achieve the ultimate goal of
    producing a progressive web application that adheres to the current industry standards.
</p>
<p>
    Although the outline of the subjects in the development of the Flix Manager application
    is based on the <span class="text-black-50">Programming in Blazor - ASP.Net Core 5</span>
    course by Felipe Gavilán, its implementation is heavily modified. Specially as it moves
    forward towards the more advanced topics. Nevertheless, I <strong>strongly</strong>
    recommend checking out his course at
    <a href="https://www.udemy.com/share/102l0i3@qPfFeIAI72jmyuTTU5ubq0Q_5VvN9_xBVIhEy0eqTcycB1CT8_zHkXA2WZCh320z/">
